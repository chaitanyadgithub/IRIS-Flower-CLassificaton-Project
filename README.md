Iris Flower Classification
This project utilizes the Iris flower dataset to classify flowers into three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By analyzing sepal and petal measurements, the goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately categorizes each flower based on its physical attributes. The Iris dataset is a popular introductory dataset for classification tasks, offering a great opportunity to practice data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. Explore this project to gain hands-on experience with classification algorithms and predictive modeling.
